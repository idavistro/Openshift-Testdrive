Hello {{ name }},

  You're receiving this because you're enroll in a OpenShft's TestDrive for Developers from Red Hat. The information below it's your environment and it must be used along with a custom VirtualMachine supplied at the begining of this activity.
  In order to get the VirtualMachine fully working, you need to join 2 splitted files into one before importing into VirtualBox. 

for Windows Users:
copy /b redhat-ocp-testdrive.ova-partaa+redhat-ocp-testdrive.ova-partab redhat-ocp.testdrive.ova

for Unix Users:
cat redhat-ocp-testdrive.ova-partaa redhat-ocp-testdrive.ova-partab > redhat-ocp.testdrive.ova

Once you've got your VirtualMachine up and running, follow the procedures below. 

Open a Terminal and become root
# su -
Password:  (type: r3dh4t1!)

...and then, execute this Ansible's Playbook
# ansible-playbook /root/setup_openshift_ips.yaml

Input the following values below:
OpenShift's Master IP: {{ openshift_master_public_ip }}
OpenShift's InfraNode IP: {{ openshift_infra_public_ip }}

After that you may open Firefox WebBrowser and input the address
https://master.testdrive.com:8443

which it's going to open OpenShift's WebConsole. Your credentials are:
Username: {{ email }}
Password: {{ user_id }}

or you can login using OpenShift Client (aka oc) by typing:
# oc login --username={{ email }} --insecure-skip-tls-verify --server=https://master.testdrive.com:8443
Authentication required for https://master.testdrive.com:8443 (openshift)
Username: {{ email }}
Password: {{ user_id }}

Because you're using a shared environment with everyone in the class, it's important that we distinguish each project. We're going to use your prefix in front of each project. 
Your prefix is: {{ user_id }}

For example, you will need to create the following projects using your prefix as such:
# oc new-project {{ user_id }}-tasks-stage --display-name="OpenShift''s Tasks: Stage Site"
